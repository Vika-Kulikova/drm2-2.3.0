We have improved the process of adding products to the Shopping Cart in the Magento 2 platform.
Right now it is not really clear if the product is added successfully or not - messages are shown at the top of the page and are not visible to the customer.
So, we have created the "Shopping Cart Notifications" extension for Magento 2 based on-line stores. It adds a tooltip at the right upper corner that clearly notifies the customer about the result of their actions.
Additionally, you can turn on the overlay with the animated loader so that customers see that the process still works and does not take other actions at that moment.
